Getting familiar with Github

Interested in getting more into Github and how it can help me develop new skillsets. 
I have been in the IT field for a while mostly in the cybersecurity space, and would like to focus on developing coding skills as a hobby for myself. Worked with some scripting languages in college but that was many years ago. 
Time for some refresher work.
